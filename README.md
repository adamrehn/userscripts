# Userscripts

This repository contains assorted [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for augmenting various web pages. The following userscripts are currently available:

- [**timezone-image-saver.user.js**](./scripts/timezone-image-saver.user.js): this script adds a button to the [Time Zone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) page of the [Time and Date AS](https://www.timeanddate.com/) website which renders the list of selected cities and times as a PNG image that can be attached to an email / chat message / etc. This is primarily useful when organising cross-timezone meetings and proposing potential options for contacts to choose from.
